Janus is a general purpose WebRTC gateway, developed by Meetecho and released as free software under the GPLv3 license.

## Personal Configurations

In this repository, I build use Dockerfile to build custom Janus image, and use Docker Compose to run Janus server.

and I also add some personal configurations to Janus server, in the [`conf` folder](./conf).
